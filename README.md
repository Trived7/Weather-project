# Weather-check

Created a beautiful weather finder website that displays current weather and 5-day forecast.
It is a practice project for me, wrote with the HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT. i just wanted to create asimple one with limited but good wanted features, by keeping it simple. Took help from chatbots- learned from them and implemented them by myself (inityially wanted to make an android app but got lazy 😅, but I'll in the future 😤)

## Features ✨

- __Real-timme weather__ : See real-time weather conditions at a glance
- __5-day forecast__ : Shows next 5 days forecast
- __Smart and advanced search__ : Find weather by city name or with the use your current location
- __Dark/Light 🌙 mode__ : wanna be blind !?, I hate light theme!
- __Search history__ : Remembers your favorite locations and last search (hassle free 🥱)
